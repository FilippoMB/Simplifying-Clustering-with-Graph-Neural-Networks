Implementation of *Just Balance GNN* (JBGNN) model for graph clustering (and for graph pooling), presented in the paper [Simplifying Clustering with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08779).

The implementation is based on [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/getting-started/), the Tensorflow/Keras library for Graph Neural Networks.
The [JustBalancePool](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Simplifying-Clustering-with-Graph-Neural-Networks/blob/main/pooling_layers.py) layer is implemented according to the [SRC](https://graphneural.network/layers/pooling/) API for graph pooling.
