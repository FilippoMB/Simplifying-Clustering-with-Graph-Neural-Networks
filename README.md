Code to reproduce the results of the *Just Balance GNN* (JBGNN) model for graph clustering (and for graph pooling), as presented in the paper [Simplifying Clustering with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08779).

The official implementation of the [JustBalancePool](https://graphneural.network/layers/pooling/#justbalancepool) layer is on [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/getting-started/), the Tensorflow/Keras library for Graph Neural Networks.
